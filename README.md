# Computational Healthcare Library 
The goal of Computational Healthcare Library is to help computer scientists do high impact healthcare research 
by providing a simple interface to large publicly available healthcare datasets.

With Computational Healthcare library you can:

- Load & analyze data from up to 200 Million visits & 70 Million patients
- Specify aggregation strategies and compute aggregate statistics in a privacy preserving manner   
- Build embedding models, perform transfer learning, predict rehospitalizations/revisits using TensorFlow 
- Benchmark results against baseline algorithms trained on publicly available datasets
- In future it can be used for testing Differential Privacy algorithms for computing aggregate statistics & privacy preserving Machine Learning   

Computational Healthcare library (chlib) is the underlying library used for building [Computational Healthcare](http://www.computationalhealthcare.com/).

## Supported datasets

Currently we support following three databases:

 1. [Texas Inpatient public use data file 2006-2009](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/thcic/hospitals/Inpatientpudf.shtm): This database contains approximately 11 Million de-identified inpatient visits from Texas during 2006-2009, this data is available as free download. Inpatients visits in this database lack patient identifier.
   
 2. [HCUP Nationwide Readmission database for 2013](https://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/nrdoverview.jsp): This database contains de-identified inpatients visits during 2013 & 14. Unlike Texas database all inpatient visits are associated with a patient identifier and its possible to track patient through multiple visits.
 
 3. [HCUP State Inpatient, ED & SASD database](http://www.hcup-us.ahrq.gov/sidoverview.jsp): This is one of the largest longitudinal database of medical claims in the world. Acquiring this database typically takes several weeks and can cost few 100$ to ~10,000$ depending number of states/years/types. We currently support data from California, Florida & New York. If you are interested in using Computational Healthcare with this dataset please contact us.

__Adding a new dataset to Computational Healthcare is a simple process. In near future we plan to extend support to databases in OHDSI format.__
           
**Please note that this repository does not contains any data, nor do we provide any data. You should acquire the datasets on your own 
  from AHRQ and/or other state agencies.**         

## Architecture & Data Model
A quick overview of data model, architecture is available in this [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Oh_-FShr3BCGiCSqghI2dQYnyKvVOeiOqkIjaaEOPwc/edit?usp=sharing).

- The library uses Protocol buffers for storing [raw data (visits & patients)](/chlib/entity/protocols/pvisit.proto) and [aggregate statistics](/chlib/entity/protocols/pstat.proto).
- Categorical fields-values are represented as [enums](/chlib/entity/protocols/penums.proto) using Protocol buffers. 
- Raw data is stored in a levelDB database
- Protocol Buffers and LevelDB makes it easy to use any programming language
- We provide code to compute aggregate statistics in privacy preserving manner
- Integrated with TensorFlow for building machine learning models
 
## Installation & Setup

- The [docker folder](docker/) contains a Dockerfile with all dependencies specified. 
It also contains script for building docker image, starting container, preparing databases from user supplied files.

- Once you have obtained data you should modify [docker/prepare_nrd.sh](docker/prepare_nrd.sh) script with correct path to .CSV file and run the script.

- For Texas dataset modify/run the [prepare_tx.sh](docker/prepare_tx.sh).

- The dockerfile uses TensorFlow version 0.11 docker image as a starting point. Thus in addition to Computational Healthcare library it 
also contains a Jupyter notebook server which runs automatically when the container is started. Once the preparation step is 
complete you can use the jupyter notebook server running (inside the container) on port 8888 of your local machine.


## Quick overview  

```python
    import chlib
    NRD = chlib.data.Data.get_from_config('../config.json','HCUPNRD')
    # patients
    for p_key,patient in NRD.iter_patients():
        break
    print p_key,patient
    
    # visits
    for p_key,patient in NRD.iter_patients():
        for v in patient.visits:
            break
        break
    print v
```

### Text description of codes and enums      
```python
    coder =  chlib.codes.Coder() 
    print 'D486',coder['D486'] # ICD-9 diagnosis codes are prepended with 'D'
    print 'P9971',coder['P9971'] # ICD-9 procedure codes are prepended with 'P'
    print coder[chlib.entity.enums.D_AMA] # You can also print string representation of Enums

### Retrieve list of patients with particular diagnosis or procedure

```python 
    patients_undergoing_plasmapheresis = [p for _,p in NRD.iter_patients_by_code('P9971')]
    # You can speed this up by precomputing list of patients for each codes, using 'fab precompute'
    print len(patients_undergoing_plasmapheresis)
    for v in patients_undergoing_plasmapheresis[0].visits:
        print v.key,v.day,v.prs
