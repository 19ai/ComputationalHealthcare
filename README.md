# Computational Healthcare Library 
The goal of Computational Healthcare Library is to help computer scientists perform high impact healthcare research 
by providing a simple interface to large publicly available healthcare datasets. Computational Healthcare library (chlib) 
is the underlying library used for building [Computational Healthcare](http://www.computationalhealthcare.com/).

With Computational Healthcare library you can:
- Load & analyze data from up to 200 Million visits & 70 Million patients
- Specify aggregation strategies and compute aggregate statistics in a privacy preserving manner   
- Build embedding models, perform transfer learning, predict rehospitalizations/revisits using TensorFlow 
- Benchmark results against baseline algorithms trained on publicly available datasets
- In future it can be used for testing Differential Privacy algorithms for computing aggregate statistics & privacy preserving Machine Learning

**Please note that this repository does not contains any data, nor do we provide any data. You should acquire the datasets 
on your own from AHRQ and/or other state agencies.**


#### Contact & Issues 
To minimize chances of visit/patient level information leaking via Exceptions messages or Traceback, we have not enabled
issues on github repo. If you find any bugs, make sure that your bug report/question does not contains any visit or patient
 level information. To file a bug please email us at address provided below. For more information, comments or if you plan 
 on citing Computational Healthcare library please contact Akshay Bhat at aub3@cornell.edu.
